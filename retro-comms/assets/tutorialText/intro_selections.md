# Relevance Selection Task

Great work tackling the mystery of Mr. Boddy and describing your findings in the previous quiz. 🕵️‍♂️ That task was intentionally tricky—and nearly impossible to solve completely in the time we gave you! You did exactly what we hoped: your best!

## What's next

On the next page, you’ll see **multiple investigation summaries** from different investigators. 🔎 
Each investigator started with the same premise and had 15 minutes to examine the evidence, but they may have approached the mystery in unique ways. 

Now that you are familiar with the evidence and some details of the mystery, please review each summary. 
✍️ Using your cursor, mark the parts of the text that you believe would be most relevant to a new investigator (**someone like you!**).

<!-- Using your cursor, you will select text, and classify the selection as **Critical**, **Helpful**, or **Optional** to a future investigator. -->

Please respond honestly—there are no right or wrong answers.
