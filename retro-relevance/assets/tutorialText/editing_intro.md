# Summary Editing

*Please read the following aloud.*

While you were completing the questionnaires, an AI model analyzed your activity and generated a summary based entirely on your interactions.

## Context

Imagine a colleague is stepping in to take over your investigation. They're helping solve the murder of Mr. Boddy alongside you, but they’re short on time. They will have just **5 minutes** to read your notes and review any supporting documents.

They need a clear, useful summary of what you’ve done so far and what still needs to be done to solve the mystery.

## Task

On the next page, you'll revise the AI-generated summary to make it as helpful as possible for your colleague—so they can quickly understand the case and determine **who** murdered Walter Boddy, with **what** weapon and **where** it occurred.

## Guidelines

On the next page, please edit your summary to:

1. **Make it approachable**: Ensure the summary makes sense to someone unfamiliar with the case.
1. **Add missing details**: Fill in any key actions the AI might have overlooked.
1. **Remove distractions**: Cut any irrelevant or confusing details.
1. **Fix errors**: Look for AI mistakes or made-up information. Proofread carefully!
1. **Clarify transitions**: Make shifts in focus or reasoning more obvious.
1. **Improve structure**: Organize the summary, so it's easy to scan and understand.

<!-- ## Guidelines vShorter
Make it understandable: Ensure someone new to the case can follow your summary.
Add what's missing: Fill in important context or insights the AI skipped.
Cut what doesn’t help: Remove irrelevant or incorrect details.
Improve flow: Make transitions and structure easy to follow.
Be clear and accurate: Proofread and polish the summary. -->

## Next Steps

**Take your time**: You have at least 10 minutes to make edits. Don't rush!

After you finish editing, you’ll highlight the parts of the summary you think will be most helpful to future users.
