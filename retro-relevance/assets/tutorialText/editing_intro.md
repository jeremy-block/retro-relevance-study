# Summary Editing

Now that you have completed the task, we have used an AI model to generate a summary of your interactions.  
*Please read the following aloud.*

## Role

You are collaborating with other investigators to solve the case about the murder of Mr. Boddy. A colleague will be stepping in to continue your work.

## Task

Refine the generated summary on the next page to ensure that a new colleague can easily pick up where you left off.

## Guidelines

• **Enhance the summary**: Make sure it’s suitable for someone unfamiliar with the case.

• **Add missing details**: Include any connections or context that the AI might have overlooked.

• **Remove irrelevant information**: Eliminate anything that wouldn’t assist the next investigator.

• **Clarify transitions**: Adjust the focus to make key transitions more obvious.

• **Structure**: Organize the summary for easy interpretation.

• **Take your time**: You have at least 10 minutes to review and make changes.

• **Ensure clarity**: Make the summary clear and complete for the next investigator.

## Next Steps

After editing, you will be asked to highlight the most helpful parts of the summary for future users.
