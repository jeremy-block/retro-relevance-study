# Task

Using the tool you just learned about, here is the premise for your investigation.

*Please read the following aloud.*

## Premise

Walter Boddy has been murdered at his estate. The police have named Mr. HENRY WADSWORTH as the primary suspect.

Mr. WADSWORTH claims he did not do it and wants your help to solve the mystery and clear his name.

You have asked a field reporter, Mr. HANS BRAUMAN, to collect evidence and track down the truth.

Your goal is to use this information to identify:

- **Who** committed the murder,
- **What** weapon was used and,
- **Where** it occurred at the Boddy Estate.

## Note

Only those involved in the murder may knowingly lie, while anyone might unknowingly provide false information.
For example, if Jake is guilty of murder and says he never saw the victim that night, he is knowingly lying (1st Degree lie).
Now, if Sarah, who is innocent, says the victim left at 8 PM--even though she wasn’t there to see them leave--but it was actually 7 PM, that’s unknowingly providing false information (2nd Degree lie).

### Are you ready to begin?

A copy of the above premise will be available in the interface.
