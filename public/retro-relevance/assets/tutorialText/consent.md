## Purpose of the research study

This research study examines how individuals summarize their investigative processes when handing off their analyses to others. The study aims to improve methods for generating and presenting provenance summaries, which document the history of an analysis process. The findings will help inform the development of tools that support the effective communication of analysis findings during shift transitions or collaborative investigations. Participants will engage with investigative datasets, generate or refine summaries of their analysis, and provide feedback on the presented information.
