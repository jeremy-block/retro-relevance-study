# Task

Using the tool you just learned about, here is the premise for your investigation.

*Please read the following aloud.*

## Premise

Walter Boddy has been murdered at his estate. The police have named Mr. HENRY WADSWORTH as the primary suspect.

Mr. WADSWORTH claims he did not do it and wants your help to solve the mystery and clear his name.

You have asked a field reporter, Mr. HANS BRAUMAN, to collect evidence and track down the truth.

Your goal is to use the documents to identify:

- **Who** committed the murder,
- **What** weapon was used and,
- **Where** it occurred at the Boddy Estate.

*A copy of this premise will be available in the interface.*

## Timing and Tools

You only have **15 minutes** to look at evidence.

*Be mindful about what you focus on.* You will **not have enough time** to read all the documents.

Right click to access the:
1. üìù **Note tool** to write down anything of interest,
2. üñäÔ∏è **Highlight tool** to mark interesting content in <span style='background-color: #77F7A4'>Green</span>, and
3. üîé **Search tool** to find documents (matching content will be in <span style='background-color: #ffea57'>Yellow</span>).

### A note about the truth

Only those involved in the murder may knowingly lie, while anyone might unknowingly provide false information.

For example, if a John Doe is guilty of murder and says he never saw the victim that night, he is knowingly lying (1st Degree lie).

Now, if Jane Doe, who is innocent, says the victim left at 8 PM, but the victim actually left at 7 PM, that‚Äôs unknowingly providing false information because she wasn‚Äôt there to see them leave (2nd Degree lie).

Only those directly involved with the murder will tell 1st degree lies. Everyone else could provide false information though.

### Are you ready to begin?

After this task, your interactions will be used to generate a summary of your investigation.
