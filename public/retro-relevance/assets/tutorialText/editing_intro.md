# Summary Editing

*Please read the following aloud.*

While you were completing those questionnaires, we have used an AI model to generate a summary based entirely on your interactions.  

## Context

Imagine a colleague is stepping in to take over your investigation. They're helping solve the murder of Mr. Boddy alongside you, but they’re short on time. They’ll have just **5 minutes** to read your notes and review any supporting documents. 

They need a clear, useful summary of what you’ve done so far and what still needs to be done.


## Task

On the next page, you'll revise the AI-generated summary to make it as helpful as possible for your colleague—so they can quickly understand the case and continue your work seamlessly.

## Guidelines

• **Make it approachable**: Ensure the summary makes sense to someone who hasn’t seen the case before.

• **Add missing details**: Fill in any key connections or reasoning the AI might have overlooked.

• **Remove distractions**: Cut out any irrelevant or confusing details.

• **Fix errors**: Double-check for AI mistakes or made-up information. Proofread carefully!

• **Clarify transitions**: Adjust the focus to make key transitions more obvious.

• **Improve structure**: Organize the summary so it's easy to scan and understand.

• **Take your time**: You have at least 10 minutes to make edits. Don't rush!

• **Ensure clarity**: Make the summary clear and complete for the next investigator.
