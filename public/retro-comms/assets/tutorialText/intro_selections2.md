# What you'll do

We want to know what makes investigative summaries helpful to a new team member-**someone like you**!

Now that you are familiar with the evidence and some details of the mystery, please use your cursor to select **words, phrases, or full sections** of the summaries.

For each selection, indicate whether it is:

- ðŸŸ¥ **Critical**
- ðŸŸ¨ **Helpful** or
- ðŸŸ© **Optional** to someone contributing to the investigative goal.

Please highlight parts that might help others identify:

- **Who** committed the murder  
- **What** weapon was used and
- **Where** it occurred at the Boddy Estate

**There are no right or wrong answers.**
