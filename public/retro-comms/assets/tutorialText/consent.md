## Purpose of the research study

We are studying how people share their investigative processes when handing off their work to others. Our goal is to improve tools that generate and present provenance summaries—records that document how an analysis was done. These findings will help us support effective communication during shift transitions or collaborative investigations.

During the study, you will work with investigative datasets, annotate summaries of previous analyses, and give feedback on how helpful the information is.
