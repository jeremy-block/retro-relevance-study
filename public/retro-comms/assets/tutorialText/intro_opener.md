# 👋 Welcome to the Study

Thank you for participating!

We want to know what makes an investigative summary helpful to a new team member—**someone like you**!

This study explores how people summarize their work and what makes those summaries useful for communicating with others.

There are **four** main phases:

1. 🎓 **Training:** First, you'll learn about a tool to review evidence.
2. 📋 **Planning:** Next, you'll review a summary of someone else’s attempt and outline a plan.
3. 🔍 **Investigation:** Then, you’ll then try to solve the mystery.
4. 📖 **Review:** Finally, you’ll read two additional summaries and mark what you think will be helpful or relevant.

🧠 There’s **a lot of reading** ahead, but you’re helping us learn **how people interpret other people's work**!
