# Relevance Selection Task

Great work tackling the mystery of Mr. Boddy and describing your findings in the previous quiz! 🕵️‍♂️ That challenge was intentionally tricky—and nearly impossible to solve in the time we gave you. You did great.

## What's next

Your next task is to review **three investigative summaries** from different investigators:

- 🟢 **One** you’ve already seen  
- 🔵 **Two** are new to you  

Each investigator started with the same case briefing and had 15 minutes to explore the evidence—but they may have taken different approaches or noticed different things.

## What you'll do

You’re helping us learn how people interpret and prioritize information. We want to know what makes an investigative summary helpful to a new team member—**someone like you**!

Your *goal* is to highlight parts of the summaries that would help others identify:

- **Who** committed the murder  
- **What** weapon was used and
- **Where** it occurred at the Boddy Estate

Now that you are familiar with the evidence and some details of the mystery, please use your cursor to select **words, phrases, or full sections** of the summaries. For each selection, indicate whether it is:

- 🟥 **Critical**
- 🟨 **Helpful** or
- 🟩 **Optional** to someone contributing to the investigative goal.

Respond honestly—**there are no right or wrong answers**
